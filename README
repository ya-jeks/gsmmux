Development continued in Berlios GSM Multiplexer Daemon project

Introduction

  This driver is based on the work of Tuukka Karvonen, (see
  README.orig) and has been modified to work with pseudo-tty's
  instead. This is far from complete. Please refer to README.orig for 
  more information about the GSM07.10 implementation. The driver is
  known to work with the following modems:

  - Sony-Ericsson GM29 
  - Siemens MC35
  - Siemens MC35i
  - Siemens MC75
  - iRZ MC52iT
  - Sony-Ericsson GM47/GM48 (not tested with the most recent version of 
                             the driver)

Instructions for Use

  ./gsmMuxd [options] <pty1> <pty2> ...
    <ptyN>              : pty devices (e.g. /dev/ptya0, or /dev/ptmx)

  options:
    -p <serport>        : Serial port device to connect to [/dev/modem]
    -f <framsize>       : Maximum frame size [32]
    -d                  : Debug mode, don't fork
    -m <modem>          : Modem (mc35, mc75, generic, ...)
    -b <baudrate>       : MUX mode baudrate (0,9600,14400, ...)
    -P <PIN-code>       : PIN code to fed to the modem
    -s <symlink-prefix> : Prefix for the symlinks of slave devices 
                          (e.g./dev/mux)
    -w                  : Wait for deamon startup success/failure
    -h                  : Show this help message

  This daemon divides one serial port into two or more "virtual" serial
  ports (pseudo TTYs) assuming the modem supports the GSM 07.10
  multiplexer protocol. This way the first virtual serial port can be
  used for e.g. GPRS dialup connection with pppd, while the other ports
  are used for modem AT commands.

  The daemon takes the pseudo TTY master devices to-be-used as
  parameter. The corresponding pseudo TTY slave devices will become the
  virtual serial ports.

  On some systems, there is only one master pseudo TTY device, the
  "/dev/ptmx". In this case, the slave TTYs will be named /dev/pts/0,
  /dev/pts/1, etc and the names of the virtual serial ports are not
  static. To solve the problem, the daemon can create symbolic links
  with static names to the dynamically changing virtual serial port
  pseudo TTY slave devices.

INSTALLATION

  To make the daemon start at system boot:
  1. Copy gsmMuxd to /usr/sbin/
  2. Copy the file "mux.d" to /etc/init.d/. 
  3. Edit the OPTIONS line of the copied file
  3. Run chkconfig --add mux.d

  If you have more than one modem you will need to 
  create a copy of the daemon executable with a different 
  name and create another init script to /etc/init.d/.

  Note that installation varies on different systems. The steps above
  should work at least on Red Hat linux distributions.
